Masterclass on the use of the ZF2 for creating web-applications
=======================

Introduction
------------
This is a simple, skeleton application using the ZF2 MVC layer and module
systems. This application is meant to be used as a starting place for those
looking to get their feet wet with ZF2.

Installation
------------

Using Composer
----------------------------

    cd my/project/dir
    php composer.phar self-update
    php composer.phar install

(The `self-update` directive is to ensure you have an up-to-date `composer.phar`
available.)
